   <ul><li>create literate citizens able to contribute to a democratic society</li>
   <li>empower each child to achieve his or her greatest academic potential</li>
   <li>shrink the excellence gap between the academic achievement of American students and that of their international peers from high-performing countries</li>
   <li>shrink the fairness gap between the academic achievement of American students living in poverty and that of their economically advantaged peers.</li>
